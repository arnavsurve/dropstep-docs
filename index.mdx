## Dropstep?

Dropstep is an **agent automation framework**.

At its core, Dropstep allows you to define intelligent workflows in a declarative, human-readable YAML format. These workflows are made up of:

- **Browser automation:** Instruct an AI agent to perform tasks in a web browser, like filling forms, navigating sites, or extracting information.
- **Shell scripts:** Run arbitrary shell commands or scripts for system-level tasks.
- **Python programs:** Embed Python for data processing, custom logic, or leverage specific Python libraries.
- **HTTP requests:** Integrate with any API or service via HTTP requests.

Dropstep is designed to bring structure and extensibility to your automations, emphasizing:

- **Repeatability:** Define a workflow once and run it consistently, ensuring reliable outcomes.
- **Reusability:** Powerful templating and variable functionality to run workflows with modular inputs.
- **Declarative syntax:** Focus on *what* you want to achieve, rather than *how* to implement the low-level details.
- **Inter-step data passing:** Seamlessly pass outputs from one step as inputs to another, creating powerful data pipelines.
- **Secrets management:** Securely handle sensitive information like API keys through varfiles, templating, and built-in redaction in logs.
- **Extensibility:** Easily extend built-in functionality by embedding shell and Python scripts for custom logic.

Whether you're automating web interactions, orchestrating local scripts, or integrating with APIs, Dropstep provides a unified platform to build and manage your automations.

## Vocabulary

To get started with Dropstep, it's helpful to understand a few core concepts:

- **Workflow:** This is the heart of Dropstep, defined in a `dropstep.yml` (or custom-named) YAML file.
- **Agent:** Agents in Dropstep are autonomous task runners, often powered by LLMs, that can operate browsers, APIs, and scripts using natural language prompts and runtime context.
- **Step:** A step is an individual unit of work within a workflow. Each step defines an intent, such as "run this shell command", "instruct the browser agent to do X", or "make a POST request to this URL". Steps are executed in the order they are defined.
- **Runner:** Runners are modular executors behind each step type (e.g. `shell`, `browser_agent`, `http`). They define how to interpret and execute each kind of task, and can be extended to support new step types.
- **Varfile:** Dropstep workflows support dynamic data. Variables allow you to inject configuration values into your workflow at runtime (e.g., from a separate `dsvars.yml` file or environment variables).
- **Provider:** Providers allow you to configure access details such as API keys and other authentication information.
