Dropstep is an **agentic automation framework**.

At its core, Dropstep lets you define intelligent workflows in a declarative, human-readable YAML format. These workflows are made up of:

- **Browser automation:** Instruct an AI agent to perform tasks in a web browser — like filling forms, uploading files, or extracting information.
- **Shell scripts:** Run arbitrary shell commands or scripts for system-level tasks.
- **Python programs:** Embed Python for data processing, custom logic, or specific library use.
- **HTTP requests:** Integrate with external APIs or services via HTTP calls.

Dropstep is designed to bring structure and extensibility to your automations, emphasizing:

- **Repeatability:** Define a workflow once and run it reliably every time.
- **Reusability:** Use variables and templating to run workflows with different inputs.
- **Declarative syntax:** Focus on *what* needs to be done, not *how* to wire it all up.
- **Inter-step data passing:** Seamlessly hand data from one step to the next.
- **Secrets management:** Securely handle API keys and tokens via varfiles and redacted logs.
- **Extensibility:** Extend workflows with custom shell or Python logic when needed.

Whether you're automating the browser, running scripts, or calling APIs — Dropstep gives you a single interface to orchestrate it all.

## Why Dropstep?

Most tools for automation give you verbose scripts, brittle bots, or visual builders that don’t scale. Dropstep is different — a pluggable, declarative framework for flexible, AI-integrated automation.

- **Agent-native:** Drive browser tasks with LLMs and natural-language prompts.
- **Code-first:** Automate shell, HTTP, and Python steps in a single YAML file.
- **Composable:** Chain logic with powerful templating and inter-step variables.
- **CLI-first:** Designed for local development, CI/CD pipelines, and headless environments.
- **Secure by default:** Secrets stay out of logs and workflows adapt to the environment.

If you've ever duct-taped Python scripts, shell commands, and RPA bots together, Dropstep is your escape hatch.
