Each Dropstep workflow consists of identifying information at the top of the file. These come in handy for logging and identification of workflows -- either in the web platform or CLI.

    The name of the workflow.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="description" type="string" required="false">
    A description of the workflow.
</ParamField>

```yaml dropstep.yml icon="file-code"
