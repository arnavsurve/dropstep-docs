A well-organized Dropstep project makes workflows easier to manage, version, and debug. While the structure is flexible, a typical project follows a standard layout.

## Recommended Project Layout

Here is a common and effective structure for a Dropstep project:

```bash icon="terminal"
📁 my-dropstep-project/
├── .gitignore
├── dropstep.yml
├── dsvars.yml
├── .env
├── scripts/
│   └── process_data.py
├── schemas/
│   └── product_details.json
└── .dropstep/
    ├── logs/
    └── output/
```

## Core Workflow Files

These are the files you will create and edit to build your workflow.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
    <Card title="dropstep.yml" icon="file-code">
        The heart of your project. This YAML file is where you define the workflow's [metadata](/workflows/metadata), required [inputs](/workflows/inputs-varfiles), external service [providers](/workflows/providers), and the sequence of [steps](/steps/overview) to be executed.
    </Card>
    <Card title="dsvars.yml" icon="file-signature">
        The variable file (short for "Dropstep variables"). This key-value YAML file provides the actual values for the `inputs` defined in `dropstep.yml` at runtime. It's the standard way to configure a workflow run without modifying the core logic. Learn more in the [Inputs & Varfiles guide](/workflows/inputs-varfiles).
    </Card>
    <Card title=".env" icon="lock">
        An optional but highly recommended file for managing secrets. Dropstep automatically loads this file, making environment variables defined within it available to your `dsvars.yml` using the `{{ env.VAR_NAME }}` syntax. **This file should be added to your `.gitignore`** to prevent secrets from being committed to source control.
    </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Supporting Directories

These are directories you might create to organize supporting files for your workflow steps.

<ResponseField name="scripts/" type="directory">
    A recommended location for your external scripts. If you have `shell` or `python` steps that use the `path` property, keeping the script files here helps maintain a clean project root.

    ```yaml dropstep.yml icon="file-code"
    steps:
      - id: process_data
        uses: python
        path: ./scripts/process_data.py
    ```
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="schemas/" type="directory">
    A recommended directory for your JSON Schema files. When using a `browser_agent` step, you can specify an `output_schema` to get structured data back. Organizing these schemas in their own directory is a best practice.

    ```yaml dropstep.yml icon="file-code"
    steps:
      - id: scrape_data
        uses: browser_agent
        browser:
          output_schema: "./schemas/product_details.json"
    ```
</ResponseField>

## .dropstep/

Dropstep creates and manages a `.dropstep` directory when you run a workflow. **You should add `.dropstep/` to your `.gitignore` file**.

<ResponseField name=".dropstep/" type="directory">
    This directory stores all the artifacts from your workflow executions.

    <Expandable title="contents" defaultOpen>
    <ResponseField name="logs/" type="directory">
        Contains detailed, structured JSON logs for every workflow run, with each file named by a unique run ID. These logs are essential for debugging.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="output/" type="directory">
        The default location for files generated by steps.
        - **`<step_id>_output.json`**: The `browser_agent` saves its structured JSON output here.
        - **`<step_id>_default_downloads/`**: If a `browser_agent` step downloads a file and no custom `download_dir` is specified, it lands here.
    </ResponseField>
    </Expandable>
</ResponseField>
