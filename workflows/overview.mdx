Dropstep workflows are defined in a declarative YAML format (by default `dropstep.yml`). This approach allows us to clearly specify *what* tasks need to be done and how they connect, rather than getting bogged down in imperative scripting for every detail.

At a high level, a workflow is made up of:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
    <Card title="Metadata" icon="folder-tree" href="/workflows/metadata">
        Essential identifying information for a workflow.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Variables" icon="code" href="/workflows/variables">
        Define parameters for your workflow to use at runtime.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Providers" icon="key" href="/workflows/providers">
        Configure access to external services.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Steps" icon="person-walking" href="/workflows/steps">
        Define behavior and chain complex operations.
    </Card>
</CardGroup>

Leverage these components to build flexible and maintainable automations with Dropstep.
