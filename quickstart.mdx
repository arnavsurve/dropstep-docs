## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Go installed on your system. You can find Go releases at [go.dev/dl/](https://go.dev/dl/).
- Git must be installed.

### Install

```bash icon="terminal"
go install github.com/arnavsurve/dropstep@latest
```

This command will fetch the latest version of Dropstep, compile it, and place the `dropstep` executable in your Go binary directory (usually `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`).

### Verify

Ensure your Go binary directory is in your system's PATH. You can verify your Dropstep installation with:

```bash icon="terminal"
dropstep --help
```

This should display the help message for the Dropstep CLI, listing available commands. If you see this, Dropstep is installed successfully.


## Your First Workflow

Let's create a workflow that uses the `browser_agent` to visit [dropstep.tech](https://dropstep.tech) and tell us what it's about.

<Note>
  **Prerequisite:** You will need access to an OpenAI API key. You can get one from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/api/).
</Note>

Create a new directory for your workflow, let's call it `my-dropstep-intro`. Inside this directory, create the following files:


#### `dropstep.yml`

```yaml dropstep.yml icon="file-code"
name: Dropstep Introduction Agent
description: An agent visits a website to find out what it is.

inputs:                                  # Define inputs for the workflow
  - name: openai_api_key
    type: string
    required: true
    secret: true                         # Mark the input as a secret to prevent it from being logged
  - name: url
    type: string
    required: true

providers:
  - name: my_openai_provider             # A user-defined name for this provider config
    type: openai                         # Specifies the LLM provider
    api_key: "{{ openai_api_key }}"      # Reference the input variable defined above

steps:
  - id: visit_dropstep_site              # A user-defined name for this step
    uses: browser_agent                  # Specifies the step type
    provider: my_openai_provider         # Specifies the user-defined provider to use
    prompt: "Go to {{ url }} and tell me about it."
```

#### `dsvars.yml`

```yaml dsvars.yml icon="file-code"
openai_api_key: "{{ env.OPENAI_API_KEY }}"
url: "https://dropstep.tech"
```

This tells Dropstep to get the values for the `openai_api_key` and `url` input variables. The `{{ env.* }}` syntax tells Dropstep to resolve the value from an environment variable.

### Provide the API Key

You still need to make your OpenAI API key available as an environment variable. There are two common ways to do this:

1. Set it as an environment variable:

```bash icon="terminal"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

2. Define it in a `.env` file in the same directory as your workflow:

```env .env icon="file-code"
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

<Info>
`.env` files are automatically loaded by Dropstep.
</Info>

### Run the Workflow

Your workflow directory should look like this:

```bash
my-dropstep-intro/
├── dsvars.yml              # Variable file
├── dropstep.yml            # Workflow definition
└── .env                    # Environment variables
```

Navigate to the `my-dropstep-intro` directory in your terminal and run:

```bash icon="terminal"
dropstep run
```

By default, logs and agent output are stored in `.dropstep/logs/`, with a separate file for each workflow run.

### Expected Outcome & Output

<Info>
The first time you run a `browser_agent` step, Dropstep will set up a virtual environment for the agent. This might take a minute or two as it downloads and installs necessary dependencies. Subsequent runs will be faster.
</Info>

You should see a browser window open and navigate to `https://dropstep.tech`. The agent will then perform the task you specified in the `prompt` field.

You'll see logs similar to this:

```text icon="terminal"
[INFO <timestamp>] workflow: Validating Dropstep Introduction Agent using dsvars.yml
[INFO <timestamp>] workflow: Successfully loaded workflow: Dropstep Introduction Agent
...
[INFO <timestamp>] visit_dropstep_site: Step completed
[INFO <timestamp>] visit_dropstep_site: Received agent output: {
    "summary": "Dropstep is a tool for declarative agentic automation, allowing users to define workflows in YAML to automate tasks like browser interactions, script execution, and API calls."
  }
[INFO <timestamp>] workflow: Workflow completed successfully. Logs can be found at ".dropstep/logs/<some_uuid>.json"
[INFO <timestamp>] workflow: Shutting down logger...
```

The key part is the agent's summary message and the final JSON output, which by default contains a `summary` field with the agent's response to your prompt. You can also find this output JSON in `.dropstep/output/visit_dropstep_site_output.json`. 

This demonstrates the browser agent's ability to perform tasks in a web browser and return structured data.

## Fin

**That's it.** You've successfully run your first Dropstep agent workflow!

This simple example demonstrates the core power of Dropstep: defining intelligent, multi-step tasks in a clear YAML format and executing them. You've seen firsthand how:

- A `browser_agent` can understand a natural language `prompt` and perform tasks in a web browser.
- `providers` are used to configure external services like OpenAI, with API keys managed securely.
- Running even sophisticated agentic tasks is streamlined with a simple `dropstep run` command.

**This is just the tip of the iceberg.** Dropstep is designed to be extensible and flexible, allowing you to define workflows that fit your specific needs.
