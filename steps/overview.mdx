The `steps` block is the core of your workflow. It defines the sequence of actions your workflow will execute. Steps are self-contained units of behavior and are executed in the order they are defined.

Dropstep provides several built-in step modules, each designed for a particular kind of operation. You can chain these steps together, passing data from one to the next, to create complex and functional automations.
